# RQ-3: Advanced Performance Metrics and Evaluations

This directory contains the implementation and analysis scripts for evaluating advanced performance metrics of Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

## Directory Structure

- `run_analysis.py`: Main script for running the advanced metrics analysis
- `RQ-3/`: Additional analysis components and utilities

## Requirements

```bash
numpy>=1.19.2
pandas>=1.2.0
matplotlib>=3.3.2
seaborn>=0.11.0
scipy>=1.6.0
sklearn>=0.24.0
```

## Running the Analysis

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Execute the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python run_analysis.py
   ```

## Analysis Features

This analysis includes:
- Advanced performance metrics calculation
- Statistical significance testing
- Comparative visualization of results
- Detailed performance analysis reports

## Configuration

The analysis can be customized by modifying parameters in `run_analysis.py`:
- Metric selection
- Analysis window size
- Statistical test parameters
- Visualization settings

## Output

The script generates:
- Performance metric reports
- Statistical analysis results
- Visualization plots
- Raw data in CSV format for further analysis

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. Memory errors: Reduce the analysis window size
2. Performance issues: Adjust the batch processing parameters
3. Missing data: Verify input data paths and formats
