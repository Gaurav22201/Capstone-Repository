# Reinforcement Learning Analysis Repository

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of various Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and their performance across different research questions (RQs). The project focuses on analyzing and comparing different RL algorithms including DDPG, TD3, SAC, and PPO in continuous action spaces.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several main directories, each focusing on specific research questions and algorithm analyses:

### Research Questions (RQs)
- `RQ-1/`: Analysis of basic RL algorithm performance
- `RQ-2/`: Comparative analysis of RL algorithms
- `RQ-3/`: Advanced performance metrics and evaluations
- `RQ4/`: Additional research findings
- `RQ5/`: Extended analysis and results
- `RQ6/`: Supplementary research outcomes

### Algorithm-Specific Analysis
- `DDPG_analysis/`: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient analysis
- `TD3_Analysis/`: Twin Delayed DDPG analysis
- `SAC_Cont_Analysis/`: Soft Actor-Critic analysis
- `PPO_Cont_Analysis/`: Proximal Policy Optimization analysis

## Getting Started

Each research question (RQ) directory contains its own README with specific instructions for running the analysis. Please refer to:
- [RQ-2 README](RQ-2/README.md) for comparative analysis setup and execution
- [RQ-3 README](RQ-3/README.md) for advanced metrics analysis setup and execution

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages (specific requirements are listed in individual RQ directories)
- Sufficient computational resources for running RL algorithms
